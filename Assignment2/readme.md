# Fourier Transformation and Filtering

In the previous assignment, we got some feeling of the Fourier theory and its application by practicing the principle of superposition. Now we also covered the
Fourier theory in the part Advanced Signal Analysis. So, it is time to do some practising with it. We are going to perform two-dimensional Fourier transformation from the timespace domain to the frequency-wavenumber domain.
